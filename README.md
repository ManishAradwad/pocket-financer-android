Pocket Financer is a secure, **privacy-first, on-device financial tracking and analytics application** designed specifically for Indian bank and card SMS notifications. It reads transactional alerts (such as bank debits, credit card swipes, UPI transfers, and deposits) and automatically populates a local dashboard.

The downloadable APK supports 64-bit ARM Android devices running Android 8.0
or newer. The x86_64 build included in the universal APK supports emulators;
32-bit-only devices are not supported.

By leveraging a local **Small Language Model (SLM)** backed by `llama.cpp` via a native JNI bridge, Pocket Financer runs its entire natural language extraction process 100% offline. **No data ever leaves your device. No cloud servers, no marketing trackers, no external APIs.**

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Offline SLM Inference**: Processes SMS message semantics entirely locally using GGUF-based local LLMs.
*   **Deterministic SMS Pre-Filtering**: A 6-stage, regex-based filter running in `< 1ms` to filter out personal numbers, marketing/OTP alerts, and non-transactional messages before running model inference, preserving device CPU and battery.
*   **Three-Phase Reasoning Pipeline**:
    *   *Phase 0 (Pre-Filtering)*: Checks sender, currency amounts, masked accounts, and action verbs; filters out OTPs and collect requests.
    *   *Phase 1 (Chain of Thought)*: Dynamic allocation of `<think>` tokens (1024 token budget) to analyze the alert sender context and message logic.
    *   *Phase 2 (Structured JSON Generation)*: Produces transaction JSON with optional **GBNF (GGML BNF) grammar** constraints. GBNF defaults off and can be enabled from Advanced diagnostics; each SMS snapshots the setting once before processing.
*   **Dynamic Hardware Auto-Tuning**: Smart hardware profiling detects device RAM capacities and CPU architectures (specifically checking for `ARMv8.2-A` instruction features like `i8mm` and `dotprod` to accelerate integer math) to select the optimal model size automatically.
*   **Disk-Based KV Cache Caching**: Saves and loads the static prefix KV cache state to/from disk using SHA-256 hashes. This cuts prefill time from ~140 seconds down to `< 100ms` on subsequent runs while automatically cleaning up old stale session files.
*   **Cryptographically Secured Database**: Persists transaction and account information in a Room database encrypted with **SQLCipher (AES-256)**, protecting the local ledger at rest.
*   **Durable Real-time & Historical Ingestion**: An Android `BroadcastReceiver` first admits raw evidence to an encrypted Room outbox, then gives WorkManager only an opaque candidate key. Inbox discovery preserves provider IDs and widens from 7 to 30 to 90 days only when no new eligible candidates are found.
*   **Fast, Resumable First Run**: The pre-shell flow contains one calm introduction and the required SMS permission. Model preparation (about 700 MB) starts only after explicit confirmation, while durable setup/import status, verified coverage, counts, and actionable failures remain visible on Home across recreation or process restart.
*   **Private, Evidence-Backed Ledger**: Saved transactions retain their source SMS sender and body in encrypted local storage. Settings provides a confirmed erase-all-local-financial-data action while preserving downloaded model files.
*   **Modern Jetpack Compose UI**: Designed around Material 3 dark-themed specs to present clean dashboards, transaction histories, system hardware capabilities, and engine diagnostics.
*   **Native Edge-to-Edge System Bars**: Integrated transparent Android system bars padding and custom color styling (`SystemBarStyle.dark`) to ensure that time, wifi, and battery icons remain white and visible on dark background themes across all Light/Dark global OS themes.

## 🧠 Three-Phase Processing Pipeline

Extracting structured data from highly unstructured, localized SMS alerts (which vary drastically across dozens of Indian financial institutions) requires a reliable and power-efficient parsing mechanism:

1.  **Phase 0: Deterministic SMS Pre-Filtering**:
    Before waking the SLM execution engine, the incoming message runs through a 6-stage regex validation check ([SmsFilterPipeline.kt](file:///d:/Personal_Projects/pocket-financer-android/pipeline/src/main/java/com/pocketfinancer/pipeline/SmsFilterPipeline.kt)) to assert that the alert contains actual transaction markers (amounts, masked accounts, action verbs) and excludes verification codes/OTPs and pending payment collect requests. If any stage fails, processing terminates instantly (taking less than 1ms), avoiding unnecessary CPU-heavy model evaluations.
2.  **Phase 1: Thinking Pass (Chain of Thought)**:
    For messages that pass the pre-filter, the system builds the inference prompt (merging the system prompt and few-shot examples) and appends `<think>` to the end. The local SLM processes the SMS semantics, reasoning step-by-step to verify transaction details.
3.  **Phase 2: Structured JSON Generation**:
    Once the thinking tag is closed with `</think>`, the native JNI engine generates the transaction JSON. The Backus-Naur Form (GBNF) grammar defined in [sms_extraction.gbnf](file:///d:/Personal_Projects/pocket-financer-android/inference/src/main/assets/sms_extraction.gbnf) is optional and defaults off. It can be enabled under Settings → Advanced diagnostics to constrain vocabulary sampling to the expected schema. The value is snapshotted once per SMS, so an in-flight extraction never mixes settings; unconstrained output still passes through the defensive extraction parser and malformed results are rejected:
    ```json
    {
      "amount": 1500.00,
      "counterparty": "MIDAS DAILY",
      "type": "debit", // or "credit"
      "account": "A/c XX6254"
    }
    ```
    With GBNF enabled, non-financial messages are constrained to the literal `"null"`. Without GBNF, the prompt requests the same output contract and the parser validates the result before anything is saved.

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations & Caching

To make local inference responsive and preserve battery life, Pocket Financer implements high-performance CPU optimizations, disk-based KV Cache caching, and automatic cleanup:
*   **Arm KleidiAI Acceleration**: Integrates Arm's official KleidiAI micro-kernels dynamically for `arm64-v8a` targets. This leverages hardware-specific `dotprod` (Dot Product), `i8mm` (Int8 Matrix Multiplication), and `sme` (Scalable Matrix Extension) instructions on supported ARMv8 and ARMv9 CPUs to dramatically accelerate quantized matrix multiplication.
*   **Dynamic KV Cache Precision (F16 vs. Q8_0)**: Automatically selects KV cache precision based on hardware capabilities. On modern CPUs supporting native FP16 calculations, it uses `F16` to leverage hardware vector math and CPU Flash Attention. On older CPUs lacking native FP16 hardware (e.g., Galaxy A50), it falls back to `Q8_0` to bypass slow software FP16 emulation overhead.
*   **Auto-Thread Tuning**: Rather than hardcoded limits, the engine configures thread counts dynamically by passing `0` to let `llama.cpp`'s native C++ scheduler determine the thread count. This defaults to `std::min(cores, 4)` (optimizing octa-core CPUs with 4 threads, which fully engages performance cores without thrashing cores or causing thermal build-up).
*   **Static Prefix Caching**: The static prompt prefix (~1,800 tokens of system prompt + few-shot examples) is prefilled once, and the native JNI engine serializes the resulting KV cache to disk as `session_<sha256>.bin` inside the secure app storage.
*   **Instant Load**: On subsequent inference runs, the pre-saved session is loaded from disk in under `100ms`, completely bypassing the heavy prefill phase.
*   **Automatic Cache Invalidation**: The session file name matches the SHA-256 hash of the static prefix. Any modifications to `system_prompt.txt` or `few_shot_examples.json` will automatically trigger a new prefill run on the next execution.
*   **Stale Cache Deletion**: To prevent disk clutter, whenever a new session file is generated, the engine automatically deletes all older stale `session_*.bin` cache files from device storage.

## 📱 Dynamic SLM Selection Matrix

To run local inference smoothly without triggering Android's low-memory killer (LMK), the app performs a detailed hardware check on startup and downloads/allocates a model matching the device's capability tier:

| Model ID | Model Family | Quantization | Size | Min. RAM | CPU Requirement | Status / Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Gemma 4 E2B Q8_0`** | Gemma 4 (E2B) | 8-bit | ~5.00 GB | **8.0 GB** | ARMv8.2-A with `i8mm` + `dotprod` | **Highest Quality** (Default for high-end devices) |
| **`Gemma 4 E2B Q4_K_M`**| Gemma 4 (E2B) | 4-bit (Medium) | ~3.10 GB | **6.0 GB** | ARMv8.2-A with `i8mm` + `dotprod` | **Balanced** (Optimal for mid-to-high devices) |
| **`Qwen3-1.7B Q8_0`** | Qwen 3 (1.7B) | 8-bit | ~1.95 GB | **4.0 GB** | ARMv8.2-A with `i8mm` + `dotprod` | **High Quality Thinking** (Default for mid-range CPU) |
| **`Qwen3-1.7B Q4_K_M`** | Qwen 3 (1.7B) | 4-bit (Medium) | ~1.10 GB | **3.5 GB** | ARMv8.2-A with `i8mm` + `dotprod` | **Balanced Thinking** (Optimal for mid-range) |
| **`Qwen3-0.6B Q8_0`** | Qwen 3 (0.6B) | 8-bit | ~0.70 GB | **2.5 GB** | Standard ARMv8 | **Lightweight Fallback** (For budget devices) |
| **Blocked** | — | — | — | **< 2.5 GB**| — | *Incompatible (Device cannot execute local SLMs)* |

*Note: GPU acceleration is disabled on Android for model selection. CPU instruction execution (using Neon assembly and specialized hardware dot product features) is substantially faster and more power-efficient than mobile GPU JNI roundtrips in llama.cpp.*

## 🔒 Hardened Security & Privacy

*   **Financial Data Stays Local**: SMS filtering, model inference, parsing, and database transactions happen on-device. Network access is used to download a model only after explicit confirmation; financial messages are not uploaded.
*   **AES-256 SQLCipher Database**: Room uses SQLCipher with a random key protected by Android Keystore-backed encrypted preferences. Database initialization fails closed if Keystore protection is unavailable, and older plaintext-fallback keys are wrapped and erased during upgrade.
*   **Source Evidence Retention**: A saved transaction retains its original SMS sender and full message body indefinitely in the encrypted local database. Rejected non-transaction messages are not retained long-term.
*   **User-Controlled Erasure**: Settings requires confirmation before erasing all local financial data and setup/import state. There is no retention-period picker.

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

For testing the application's offline AI ingestion pipeline without using real bank alerts, we provide testing scripts and developer utilities:

### 1. Ingest Mock Transactions
Run the Python script in the workspace root to inject exactly 20 test SMS messages (including both transactional debits/credits and promotional spams) into your emulator's telephony provider:
```powershell
python inject_sms.py
```
This utility automatically configures shell appops permissions (`WRITE_SMS`) and restarts the Android Messages application to refresh the inbox view.

### 2. Replay First Run
To test the onboarding sync visual elements repeatedly:
- Open the application and navigate to the **Settings** tab.
- Open **Data & privacy** and tap **Erase all local financial data**.
- Review the scope and confirm the destructive action.
- The app resets encrypted ledger/outbox tables and setup/import metadata, clears the shell gate, cancels financial notifications, and recreates the activity to launch the short Welcome flow.
- A valid downloaded SLM artifact remains in internal storage. After SMS permission is restored, Home truthfully shows that the local model is ready and waits for an explicit history-scan action; it does not silently start a download or import.
